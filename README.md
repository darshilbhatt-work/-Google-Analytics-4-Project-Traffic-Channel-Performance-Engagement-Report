# Google Analytics 4 Project – Traffic Channel Performance & Engagement Report

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Google Analytics 4 Free Form Report** focused on understanding traffic channel-wise revenue distribution and engagement metrics.  
The analysis was conducted using the **Google Merchandise Store Demo Account** provided by Google.  
I built three core visualizations using GA4’s custom reporting features to answer targeted business questions. The report was designed in **Canva** for a clean and professional presentation.

**Disclaimer:** This project uses demo data; no real business data is involved.
